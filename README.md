Hobbies

## My Philosophy
If you want to fly in the sky, you need to leave the earth. If you want to move forward, you need to let go of the past that drags you down.

## Quotes
When all is lost, when all is let go of, when all is abandoned, what you are left with is an ocean of bliss

The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present
